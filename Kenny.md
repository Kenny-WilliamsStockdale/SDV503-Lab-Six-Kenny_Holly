## Coding began 

This week for lab six began with pair coding. Pair coding has been a hot topic and one I've found that puts developers in a more real world environment where team work and communication are essential for developing the example applications assigned to the class.  This type of development is an agile software developments and uses the terms "Driver" and "Navigator" which puts the pair of developers into the respective roles. The 'navigator' will help the 'driver' who is working at the keyboard typing code, observe and review the code being written. The roles can switch between developers as needed and helps teach skills such as strategic and tactical aspects of coding 

My pair coding partner was Holly. We started by organizing our structure of how to procced into this lab. I began by setting up the file structures for the entire repository which for me was straightforward. Holly agreed to be the first driver and I would be the first navigator. 

## Attempting to function () 

Upon looking over the tasks and what was to be required I oddly found myself in a disconnect. I struggled to read what the tasks were asking and how I could put the requirements into code. This concerned me a lot. But once I realized the recent class activities we had been over I found it a good practice to look over past materials we had been over in understanding and attempt to refactor some of those materials to suit the current task we were undertaking. 

Consulting with Holly we managed to get ourselves via driver and navigator part way through task one but found we were still lacking in completing all the requirements. At this point I asked over my tutor Ali for some advice in the right direction. He ran through the task scenario in front of both of us in the form of drafting a todo list on paper. I found this to be a very handy technique for breaking down the problem and solving it. 

As Ali went down the list on paper he asked us what statements should be made in our functions to meet the requirements, I could answer him correctly and understand the theory of what he was asking. Unfortunately I could not manage to put it into code very well and this boiled down to one very simple little fact... I had not practiced coding often or enough. This realization to me, left me feeling hugely disappointed in myself.         

## Making it happen

I knew sitting there feeling disappointed was not going to help me or my pair coding partner so I decided to go into research mode and draw upon any resources I could find to help me develop in understanding and in turn help me achieve the requirements for the tasks. Obviously this was not as helpful as having practiced code but as time was sensitive I believed this would help me in the future have a fuller understanding of JavaScript.

Pressing on Holly and I had managed to complete tasks 1 and 2 but now 3 was giving us some trouble. In this task the requirement was to pass an object through a function and using object arguments to return a total sum through the function statements. Originally, I had come up with a function on my own after hours at home to help practice/reinforce my coding. This functionâ€™s result had the outcome I was after, but the arguments were not included in an object format.

The result I wanted that meets the requirements ended up being shorter as Ali, my tutor helped me with some very basic syntax after seeing my above code. This helped me learn how to call the object properties using dot notation from there I could make the code less hardcoded and more generic. With the help of some variables taking on the values of my dot notation I could then use these variables in my function statement to fulfil the requirements of the task and intake the object arguments when calling the function (from the console.log) to give me the result that I was after.

## Conclusion

Overall, I was challenged and felt disappointed in my abilities to complete these tasks comfortably in my own mind. But having Holly as my code partner helped me think of solutions in a different light and sometimes having different points of view and different experiences to draw off can make all the difference. On a personal note, this disappointment I feel is the big kick start I need to make sure I am up to date and comfortable with taking on challenges like this and feeling more capable in JavaScript.
