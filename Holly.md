## In the Beginning 

in the beginning, there was code and there was confusion. But for Lab Six, I was fortunate enough to be paired with a great partner, who was as committed (pun intended) to putting in a decent amount of effort to submit a great lab, and come away from this experience with a clear understanding of the code we wrote and new mind for vital coding knowledge. This Lab required 'pair coding' with Kenny, in which we were tasked with taking turns 'driving'(entering/executing code) and 'navigating'(instructing the driver in the code they need to type). We were given 3 tasks to complete together. Kenny set up the repo and created the necessary folders and files, I was grateful to be able to watch him do this as this was my first experience pair coding and it had been several weeks since we went over the Github set up for this work environment, which worked as a nice refresher for me.

#### <u>Task 1</u>

Kenny and I began with breaking down the first task and pulling possible code from previous lessons, that could help with creating the method we would need to successfully complete the coding requirements. It was all rather baffling initially, I found it hard to find a starting point to work from, we went through a bit of a 'process of elimination' activity, which did help start our block of code, however we hit a bump in the road with this method and had to reevaluate another way to approach the task. At this stage, Kenny and I had decided on myself as the 'driver' and Kenny, the 'navigator' for task one, but while we were problem solving this issue we both took to researching alternative methods and possible solutions, I found MDN and W3schools crucial during this time, also the weekly SDV JavaScript coding playground files, from previous lessons came in super handy.

At this point, we asked Ali to help us with an initial stepping stone, in understanding our direction in problem solving this mindbender, as we felt we weren't making any progress and were pretty stuck. after Ali explained some of the initial steps we needed to take in our planning of the code, and wrote down an example using paper, things started to click more for us. Kenny and I made sure to take some extra time at the end of the day to go over the code established, I found that the step of commenting each line of code, further reiterated the procedure and outcome. completing task one felt great, though it did reinforce the realization of my need to practice practice practice code whenever I possibly can.

In the end we found the use of a for loop to iterate the number data and increment by 1 if it was less than our assigned parameter and an if statement, giving a condition relating to the variable remainder and strict inequality were important steps we needed for this task.

#### <u>Task 2</u>

For task 2, we needed to create a function that took an array of non-negative integers and strings and returned a new array without the strings. This seemed to come easier to us,  after the research and reviewing we did for Task 1, we used similar methods but this time needed to included a forEach loop to run a function through our array and a typeof condition for the number. We also needed to use two dot notations to filter out any double up's of numbers from different data types. Doing this Task felt easier than the last, because of what we learnt doing Task 1, I can see the filter and index dot notations coming in really handy when dealing with massive amounts of data and also can picture some websites I have used that might utilize this. Again, the job of 'driving' here, helped a lot in hands on experience and understanding, the comment lines were useful again in having to really think about what we were doing, to be able to write them out in a clear explanation.



#### <u>Task 3</u>

Kenny took the driver's seat with this task, but made sure to keep me up to date an explain the process, the initial solution had  the right components but just needed some altering to run the results in the correct order, on the Wednesday, I felt like I was really struggling by the time we were dealing with Task 3, it was late afternoon and  I just couldn't seem to take on the new information, but the next day, going over task 3 with Kenny was great and surprisingly simple. I would like to practice this method over the holiday break to see what else I could apply it to.



#### <u>Conclusion</u>

I felt like if I had been able to master earlier stages of coding that we had covered in class, this all would have come to me much faster, even with some of it being new code to me, the bases of it was what we had learnt, or the short form version, this lead to  a discussion about the desire of wanting and needing to spend more time practicing code, and the realization of it being incredible crucial to keeping up in class and with assignment requirements, along with first learning code in general, it seems repetitive practice is the only way to really retain the information. despite, feeling great about understanding the lesson in class, the really understanding comes in repeating the lesson content in free time.

I feel lucky to have had Kenny as a partner, he was super patient with me and the extra time I needed to get my head around things. He also taught me some great new tricks in JavaScript that I'll use all the time now. as far as pair coding goes, this was a really positive introduction, the mutual joy we had in both discovering successful ways to fulfil the task requirements and problem solve as a team made the initial mind boggling confusion all worth it in the end.
