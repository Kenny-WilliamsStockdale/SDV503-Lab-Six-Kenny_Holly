### In the Beginning 

in the beginning, there was code and there was confusion. But for Lab Six, I was fortunate enough to be paired with a great partner, who was as committed (pun intended) to putting in a decent amount of effort to submit a great lab, and come away from this experience with a clear understanding of the code we wrote and new mind for vital coding knowledge.

Kenny and I began with breaking down the first task and pulling possible code from previous lessons, that could help with creating the method we would need to successfully complete the coding requirements. It was all rather baffling initially, I found it hard to find a starting point to work from, we went through a bit of a 'process of elimination' activity, which did help start our block of code, however we hit a bump in the road with this method and had to reevaluate, another way to approach the task. At this point, Kenny and I had decided on myself as the 'driver' and Kenny, the 'navigator', 

At this point, we asked Ali to help us with an initial stepping stone, in understanding our direction in problem solving this mindbender.
